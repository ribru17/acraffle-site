# acraffle-site
Website developed for a client by myself (backend & some frontend) and a partner (frontend)
## About the site
The website employs Oauth2 to access the Discord API so that users can sign in with their Discord account when wanting to shop on the site.
The site uses Stripe to handle payments once a user is signed in and will give them a product based on how much they pay.
The site uses cookies to store a refresh token so users don't have to continually sign in each time they access the website.
